## Project Overview

I have redesigned and enhanced specific sections of the Funngro website as part of this sample.

My work includes revamping the **main landing page** and the **Teenlancer page**, with a focus on improved UI structure, visual clarity, and overall user experience.

Please note that this is **not a full rebuild of the entire platform**. Only the pages mentioned above were redesigned and optimized by me for demonstration purposes.
